## Your Atlas Database Details

**Connection String:**
```
mongodb+srv://easypcworlddev_db_user:2gD9bDhq9s09A4pd@cluster0.agetgnb.mongodb.net/pcbuilder?appName=Cluster0
```

**Database:** `pcbuilder`
**Host:** `cluster0.agetgnb.mongodb.net`
**Status:** ✅ Active and populated

---

## What This Means

✅ **Your cloud database is ready for deployment**
- All product data is now in MongoDB Atlas
- Your app can run from the cloud
- Data is backed up and accessible worldwide

✅ **Local database is unchanged**
- Your original data is still on your PC
- You can continue local development
- Two separate databases (local + cloud)

---

## Next Steps - Deploy to the Web!

Now that your data is in the cloud, you're ready to deploy:

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended - Easiest)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Login with GitHub
3. "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select `ezpcnew` repository
5. Add environment variables (use `.env.atlas` values)
6. Deploy! (~5 minutes)

### Option 2: Render (Free Tier Available)

1. Go to https://render.com
2. Login with GitHub
3. "New +" → "Web Service"
4. Select `ezpcnew` repository
5. Add environment variables (use `.env.atlas` values)
6. Deploy! (~5 minutes)

## Environment Variables for Deployment

Copy these into your deployment platform:

```

DB_NAME=pcbuilder
NODE_ENV=production
AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKPAZQZEQT1756001416

## Verification Scripts Created

I've created helper scripts for you:

- `test-atlas-connection.js` - Test Atlas connection
- `check-local-collections.js` - Check local database
- `migrate-to-atlas.js` - Re-run migration if needed
- `verify-atlas-data.js` - Verify Atlas data

---

## Important Notes

### Two Database Setup

**Local (Development):**
- URI: `mongodb://localhost:27017/pcbuilder`
- Used when `.env` is configured for local
- Fast, no internet required
- For development and testing

**Atlas (Production):**
- URI: MongoDB Atlas connection string
- Used when `.env.atlas` is used or deployed
- Cloud-based, accessible anywhere
- For production/web deployment

### Keeping Data in Sync

If you add/modify data locally and want it in Atlas:
1. Run `node migrate-to-atlas.js` again
2. It will overwrite Atlas data with local data
3. No duplicates - old data is replaced

If you add data in Atlas (via web app) and want it locally:
1. You'll need to export from Atlas and import to local
2. Or just keep them separate (recommended)
